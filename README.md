# MachineLearning-ML
Machine Learning
- The project predicts the yaw pitch and roll and is able to draw the 3 axis on both an image and video 
- The dataset used is is the AFLW2000 
  - it contains 2000 images and each image has a coreesponding matlab file carrying some info about the photo 
- media pipe was used to get the 468 point of the face 
  - the training and model choosing  was done in the first notebook 
    - Ahmed_Solieman_mesh_analysisipynb
  - the testing of the model was done on the second notebook
    - test.ipynb
 - The model for predicting the pitch, yaw and roll is attached 
    yaw_pred.sav
    roll_pred.sav
